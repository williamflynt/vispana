## Quickstart

Vispana is packaged in docker and available in [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/vispana/vispana).

To run, execute:
```shell
docker run -p 4000:4000 vispana/vispana
```

Access on: [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

It will ask for the uri of a config-server in your cluster.

## Running Locally

Set up your system using the [prerequisites](https://github.com/vispana/vispana/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#prerequisites) section of `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

Then run the start script!

```shell
./start.sh
```

If you don't want to use the script, you can always run the commands yourself.

```shell
mix deps.get
npm --prefix ./assets install ./package.json
mix phx.server
```
